          <h2>About Me</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          I’m a generalist programmer with a passion for algorithms, operating systems, and networking. My main programming languages are C++ and Python, and I enjoy tackling challenging problems that push me to learn and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I love exploring technology in all its forms. You’ll often find me reading textbooks, experimenting with UNIX systems, or running Jupyter notebooks to explore ideas and make sense of complex questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not in front of a computer, I stay active by running or biking around the city, and I also enjoy the quiet challenge of a good game of chess.
